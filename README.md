# TUS_PathOptimization
October 20, 2023

Optimizing ultrasound path is computation intensive. Here is a heuristic approach to approximately find the best transducer prosition based on 
1. perpendicular orientation of the transducer (relative to the head) 
2. shortest distance from transducer to the target region
