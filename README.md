# **PlanTUS** - A tool for heuristic planning of TUS transducer placements

PlanTUS helps users of transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) to interactively and heuristically select the most promising transducer placement(s) for sonication of a specific target region of interest in a given individual.

Transducer positions selected using PlanTUS should always be validated using proper acoustic simulations!** <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff3850a9-2ed8-43a8-b93c-f28a9d0d7c2e" width="20" />

# Instructions

## 0. Before using PlanTUS

### What you need
In order to use PlanTUS, you need the following files:
- T1-weighted (T1w) MR image of your participant's head (.nii file)
- (optionally: T2-weighted (T2w) MR image of your participant's head (.nii file))
- Mask of your region of interest (co-registered to/in the same space as your participant's T1w image; .nii file)
  
### Charm
Make sure to run the SimNIBS charm pipeline (https://simnibs.github.io/simnibs/build/html/documentation/command_line/charm.html) on your participant's T1w (and T2w) MR image before using PlanTUS. Charm segments the head into different tissue types. This segmentation is used to extract a head and skull mask, from which we generate a 3D model of the head and skull. 

**Note:** If you want to use the PlanTUS output (i.e., the planned transducer position) for acoustic simulations in **k-Plan** (https://k-plan.io/), make sure to linearly co-register your participant's T1w MR image to a suitable MNI template (to get an image with an affine matrix that has all off-diaginal elements set to 0) and set the left, posterior, inferior corner of the image to (0,0,0) *before running charm*. You can use the Python script that is provided in this repository.


## 1. Specify variables
Specify the variables in the *PlanTUS_wrapper.py* script (see script for example values).

**Subject-specific variables**
- *t1_filepath*: Path to T1 image (output of SimNIBS' charm).
- *simnibs_mesh_filepath*: Path to head mesh (.msh file generated by SimNIBS' charm).
- *target_roi_filepath*: Path to mask of target region of interest (in same space as T1 image; note: PlanTUS output folder will have same name as this file).

**Transducer-specific variables**
- *max_distance*: Maximum focal depth of the transducer (in mm).
- *min_distance*: Minimum focal depth of the transducer (in mm).
- *transducer_diameter*: Diameter of the transducer aperture (in mm).
- *max_angle*: Maximum allowed angle for tilting the transducer relative to the skin surface (in degrees).
- *plane_offset*: Offset between the radiating surface and exit plane of transducer (in mm).
- *additional_offset*: Additional offset between the skin and exit plane of transducer (in mm; e.g., due to addtional gel/silicone pad or other coupling media).
- *focal_distance_list*, *flhm_list*: Focal distance and corresponding FLHM values (both in mm) according to, e.g., calibration report.


## 2. Run the *PlanTUS_wrapper.py* script

Based on the subject-specific anatomical MR image and mask of the target region, PlanTUS generates useful metrics that help you to intuitively evaluate potential transducer positions:
- **Distance [in mm] between skin surface and target region.** A black outline indicates the restricted area on the head surface (see screenshot below), from which you would be able to reach the target brain region, given the usually limited focal depth of your transducer. In practice, it therefore only makes sense to place the transducer somewhere within this area.

- **Intersection [in mm] between the target region and an idealized acoustic beam trajectory.** In practice, you would want this intersection to be as large as possible. Note that the acoustic beam trajectory is modelled as a simple straight line going perpendicular form the head surface into the brain. This is, of course, a very simplified assumption and does not take into account, e.g., effects of skull on the ultrasound trajectory (e.g., aberrations). Hence, validation using more realistic acoustic simulations is necessary.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6747049-5366-4cfd-9550-d43431a113b7" width="200" />

- **Transducer tilt angle [in degrees] required to make the idealized beam trajectory intersect with the target region.** In practice, this angle should be as small as possible, to prevent (1) difficulties with coupling and fixating the transducer to the head surface and (2) strong reflections of the ultrasound.
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f331eaf-b1d7-48aa-bf0d-d5b1f946078b" width="200" />

- **Angle [in degrees] between the normal vectors of the skin and skull surface (i.e., angle of incidence).** In practice, an area with as little discrepancy between the skin and skull normal as possible is preferable for transducer placement to minimize reflections of the ultrasound by the skull.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee09ef52-18f0-4045-86f1-64d3c3aaf0c7" width="200" />

Note that PlanTUS also automatically identifies no-go or avoidance regions (grey areas on the head surface in the screenshot below) where placing a transducer is not possible (e.g., around the ears, eyes, or nose, or above and around air-filled cavities/sinuses).

## 3. Select transducer position(s)

The aforementioned metrics will be visualized in **Connectome Workbench** on the 3D-reconstructed head surface:

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3d85c4-4056-4bb6-99aa-23b82feb822d" width="800" />


To select a potential transducer placement, simply click on the head surface wherever you would like to place the transducer. A small white sphere will appear at the respective position, marking the position of the transducer center on the head surface. The volume view (right) then allows you to check the intersection between the target region and an idealized acoustic beam trajectory (blue/green straight line) going from that position into the brain.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf6c9517-e4d4-444f-97b5-d49475feafd9" width="800" />

After clicking on a position, you will be asked if you want to generate a transducer placement for the selected position. If you select "No", nothing happens and you can continue selecting other positions. If you select "Yes", a new window pops up (see below).



## 4. Evaluate transducer and (estimated) focus position

After selecting a position, a new Connectome Workbench window pops up that shows the resulting transducer placement (left) and a simplified representation of the expected acoustic focus (red outline) overlaid on the target mask (green) and anatomical MR image (volume view on the right).

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44b4f69a-df07-47eb-8858-e0da64af2172" width="800" />


The oblique volume view (right) will help you to evaluate the expected on- vs. off-target stimulation in terms of overlap between the simplified acoustic focus and the target region – which is also quantified and reported by planTUS (to be implemented).

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72fd9a0a-f7dc-461f-82db-82ea601e2751" width="800" />



## 5. Use PlanTUS outputs with acoustic simulation software

PlanTUS outputs several files for further use with different…

**acoustic simulation software** – for validation of the selected transducer placement(s).  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12315d1b-24ba-42bb-ab98-0d6b4bde651f" width="200" />


**neuronavigation software** – for MR-guided navigation of the transducer to the selected position(s).  
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/540e9535-a9a4-4ea4-ac2a-0eebd15982ac" width="200" />




**k-Plan example**: Using the PlanTUS output files, the selected transducer placement can be easily imported into the k-Plan software (https://k-plan.io/) for validating the heuristically selected transducer placement with proper acoustic simulations.

## 6. Review simulation results

Eventually, acoustic simulation results (e.g., acoustic pressure maps) can be loaded and evaluated in the same environment (Connectome Workbench). White outlines in the volume view (right) indicate the borders of the target region.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77ef1860-d809-4b43-a60a-c712257150ee" width="800" />


Again, the oblique volume view (right) can help you to evaluate on- vs. off-target stimulation in terms of overlap between the simulated acoustic focus and the target region (indicated by white outline) – which can also be quantified by planTUS (to be implemented).
